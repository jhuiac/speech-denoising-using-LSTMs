# speech-denoising-using-LSTMs

In this project, Deep Neural Networks are used to build speech denoising models.
The models are trained on TIMIT dataset.

Please refer to report for detailed explanation of the project.

This project is an extension to my [previous project](https://github.com/pbskumar/speech-denoising-using-DeepNeuralNets) using Deep Neural Nets 

#### Future work:
Working on using GRUs and CNNs to build denoising models.


#### NOTE:
The implementation of input pipeline is not optimal. 
I am currently working on re-implementing the project using optimal input pipelines and estimator.
